The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of \u00e2\u0088\u009a2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label \"120\u00ce\u00a9 or to taste\".  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled \"glue open\".  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled \"brown blue orange\". To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a \"solder blob\".  The rightmost component is a \"666 timer\" that has pin 5 going into a question mark.\n\nBack to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled \"pull this wire really tight.\"  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short \"omit this if you're a wimp.\"  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with \"11kg\", a batman symbol, and a squirrel.\n\nBack to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3\n8\" from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled \"caution \u00e2\u0086\u00b1\".  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as \"warm front\".\n\nUnderneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled \"\u00eb\".  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as \"Moral rectifier\"  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. \n\nUnder the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with \"electrons single file\".  To the right is a switch labeled \"hire someone to open and close switch real fast.\"  To the right of that is a contact labeled \"touche tongue here\".  Below that is a resistor labeled \"5\u00ce\u00a9 (decoy)\" with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1\u00ce\u00a9 resistors labeled with \"oh, so you think you're such a whiz at EE201?\"\n\nConnected to the wire labeled \"electrons single file\" is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled \"bury deep, but not too deep.\"  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of \u00cf\u0080, and a 500V AC source.\n\nUnder the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label \"\u00e2\u0086\u0090 to center of sun\".  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled \"may use an actual sandal instead\".  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled \"8mm\", a resistor symbol labeled \"not a resistor; wire just does this\", and a motor symbol labeled \"to scale\".\n\nUnder the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled \"tear collector\".  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled \"take off shirt while wiring this part.

Apologies from the transcriber, who did her best to include as much as she could without going nuts.]]\n\n((Label in the center of main map.))\nUpdated Map of Online Communities\nSize on map represents volume of Daily Social activity (posts, chat, etc). Based on data gathered over the \nSpring and Summer of 2010\n\n[[Two insets on the upper left-hand corner shows that this map is a tiny portion of the huge continent of Spoken Language, encompassing portions of the Internet, Email, and Cell Phones (SMS).]]\n\n[[The largest landmass on the map by far, which takes up nearly the entire northern half of the map is \"Facebook\" -- with large states in the southeast of the country labeled 'Farmville' and 'Happy Farm'. There is a much smaller state to the west of these called 'Farm Town'. To the north of these states is a large swath of unremarkable land entitled 'Northern Wasteland of Unread Updates.' This is directly north of the large Dopamine Sea.\n\nA peninsula on the southwest, just below the Plains of Awkwardly Public Family Interactions, houses many tiny states, such as MySpace, Orkut, LinkedIn, Bebo, & Hi5. It is bordered on the south by Buzzword Bay, which contains several islands of varying sizes. Among these are YouTube and Twitter (the largest), which are separated by the Social Media Consultant Channel. To the southeast of Twitter, across the Sea of Protocol Confusion, is another, equally large island. Most of it is Skype, with the north having two largish states called AIM and Windows Live Messenger. On the southwest part of the island are two smaller states called GG and Yahoo Messenger.\n\nThe Island of Skype is extremely close to, but separated by the Great Firewall (a dashed line), the large landmass of QQ. It's north shore is the Gulf of China and Grass Mud Horse Bay. Outside of these bays, over the Great Firewall are two islands called Craigslist and 2Channel.\n\nIn the Dopamine Sea, off the southern shores of Farmvile and Happy Farm, is MMO Isle. Its largest state is WoW, with Runescape, Lineage, Maple Story, Habbo, and the Mountains of Steam among its notable landmarks. To the southeast of the island is the Gulf of Lag, in which sits the CDC Games island, with Eve Online.\n\nTo the east of Twitter is Troll Bay, with such islands as Reddit and Reddit, Digg, Stumbleupon, Delicio.us, and Wikipedia Talk Pages. To their south are the IRC isles, of which one is the tiny island of #xkcd.\n\nEast of these islands, and north of Skype island, is the Sea of Memes. In this sea, to the north of Craigslist and 2Channel, is an archipelago of tiny islands. There is an inset, labeled 'Forums.' (See below.)\n\nTo the southwest if Twitter island, in the Sea of Opinions, are the blog islands. These lie south of the islands in Buzzword Bay, as well. The northernmost islands in this group are centered around the Bay of Drama, on which can be found Diary Blogs, Gossip Blogs, and Livejournal. Gossip Blogs share an island with Political, Music, and Tech Blogs. To the north of this island is a smaller island called Photo Blogs. South of Diary Blogs, and off the southwest coast of Music blogs is a smaller island called Fandom Blogs. South of Tech Blogs, off of which sprouts the small peninsula of Business Blogs, is the Spamblog Straits. On the other side of the straits is a large island made up of Miscellaneous Blogs, with two states demarcated as Religious Blogs and Blog Blogs. Southwest of the Blog Islands is the Sea of Zero (0) Comments.]]\n\n[[An inset of a group of islands in the sea of memes located on the lower right corner of the map, labeled 'Forums'. The largest by far is 4chan and \nb\n. Also found here are D2JSP, JLA Frums, Fan Forum, Something Awful, and many smaller ones, too numerous to list here.]]\n\n[[The northeastern third of Gossip\nPolitical\nTech Blogs island is another inset labeled 'Blogosphere (Core)'. This can be found on the lower left corner of the map. Two peninsulas in Political Blogs bookend the Bay of Flame -- these are Liberal Blogs and Conservative Blogs. Between them lie several tiny islands such as Politics Daily, CNN Politcal Ticker, and Mediaite. Off the coast of Liberal Blogs lies the island of NYTimes, off the coast of Conservative Blogs is Libertarian Isle. Between the two lies The Talk. The northern peninsula of Tech Blogs contains places such as Gizmodo, Engadget, Joystiq, and Kotaku.]] \n\n((Text found between the two insets, which are directly below the main map.))\nABOUT THIS MAP\nCommunities rise and fall, and total membership numbers are no longer a good measure of a community's current size and health. This updated map uses size to represent total social activity in a community -- that is, how much talking, playing sharing, or other socializing happens there. This meant some paring of apples and oranges, but I did my best and tried to be consistent.\n\nEstimates are based on the numbers I could find, but involved a great deal of guesswork, statistical inference, random sampling, nonrandom sampling, a 20,000-cell spreadsheet, emailing, cajoling, tea-leafing reading, goat sacrifices, and gut instinct (i.e. making things up).\n\nSources of data include Google and Bing, Wiipedia, Alexa, Big-Boards.com, StumbleUpon, Wordpress, Akismet, every website statistics page I could find, press releases, news articles, and individual site employees. Thanks in particular to folks at Last.fm, LiveJournal, Reddit, and the New York Times, as well as sysadmins at a number of sites who shared statistics on condition of anonymity.\n\n{{Title text: Best trivia I learned while working on this: 'Man, Farmville is so huge!

,{"month": "6", "num": 1227, "link": "", "year": "2013", "news": "", "safe_title": "The Pace of Modern Life", "transcript": "((This strip is in the form of a long series of quotes. Here, each quote is given as a separate panel. Attribution is delimited with a --. Some text is bolded; it is enclosed in asterisks.))\n*The art of letter-writing is fast dying out.* When a letter cost nine pence, it seemed but fair to try to make it worth nine pence... Now, however, we think we are too busy for such old-fashioned correspondence. *We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper.*\n-- The Sunday Magazine\n1871\n\nIt is, unfortunately, one of the chief characteristics of modern business to be always in a hurry. *In olden times it was different.*\n-- The Medical Record\n1884\n\nWith the advent of cheap newspapers and superior means of locomotion... the dreamy quiet old days are over... for *men now live think and work at express speed.* They have their \nMercury\n or \nPost\n laid on their breakfast table in the early morning, and if they are too hurried to snatch from it the news during that meal, they carry it off, to be *sulkily read as they travel... leaving them no time to talk with the friend who may share the compartment with them*... the hurry and bustle of modern life... lacks the quiet and repose of the period when our forefathers, the day's work done, took their ease...\n-- William Smith, Morley: Ancient and Modern\n1886\n\nConversation is said to be a lost art... good talk presupposes leisure, both for preparation and enjoyment. *The age of leisure is dead, and the art of conversation is dying.*\n-- Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly, volume 29\n1890\n\nIntellectual laziness and the hurry of the age have produced *a craving for literary nips*. The torpid brain... has grown too weak for sustained thought. \n*There never was an age in which so many people were able to write badly*. \n-- Israel Zangwill, The Bachelors' Club\n1891\n\n*The art of pure line engraving is dying out. We live at too fast a rate* to allow for the preparation of such plates as our fathers appreciated. If a picture catches the public fancy, the public must have an etched or a photogravured copy of it within a month or two of its appearance. The days when engravers were wont to spend two or three years over a single plate are for ever gone. \n-- Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, volume 1\n1892\n\nSo much is exhibited to the eye that *nothing is left to the imagination*. It seems almost possible that the modern world might be choked by its own riches, *and human faculty dwindle away amid the million inventions that ahve been introduced to render its exercise unnecessary*.\nThe articles in the quarterlies extend to thirty or more pages, but *thirty pages is now too much*. So we witness a further condensing process and, we have the \nfortnightly\n and the \ncontemporary\n which reduce thirty pages to *fifteen pages* so that you may read a larger number of articles in a shorter time and in a shorter form. As if this last condensing process were not enough the condensed articles of these periodicals are *further condensed* by the daily papers, which will give you *a summary of the summary* of that which has been written about everything. \n*Those who are dipping into so many subjects and gathering information in a summary and superficial form lose the habit of settling down to great works*. \nEphemeral literature is driving out the great classics of the present and the past... *hurried reading can never be good reading*. \n-- G. J. Goschen, First annual address to the students, Toynbee Hall, London\n1894\n\nThe existence of *mental and nervous degeneration among a growing class of people*, especially in large cities, is an obvious phenomenon... the mania for stimulants... diseases of the mind are almost as numerous as the diseases of the body... this intellectual condition is characterized by *a brain incapable of normal working... in a large measure due to the hurry and excitement of modern life*. with its facilities for rapid locomotion and almost instantaneous communication between remote points of the globe*...\n-- The Churchman, volume 71\n1895\n\nIf we *teach the children how to play* and encourage them in their sports... *instead of shutting them in badly ventilated schoolrooms*, the next generation will be more joyous and will be heailthier than the present one. \n-- Public Opinion: A Comprehensive Summary of the Press Throughout the World, volume 18\n1895\n\nThe cuase of the... increase in nervous disease is *increased demand made by the coditions of modern life upon the brain*. Everything is done in a hurry. *We talk across a continent, telegraph across an ocean*, take a trip to Chicago for an hour's talk... *We even take our pleasures sadly and make a task of our play*... What wonder if the pressure is almost more than our nerves can bear. \n-- G. Shrady (from P. C. Knapp) \"Are nervous diseases increasing?\" Medical Record\n1896\n\n*The managers of sensational newspapers*... do not try to educate their readers and make them better, but tend to *create perverted tastes and develop vicious tendencies*. The owners of these papers seem to have but one purpose, and that is to increase their circulation.\n-- Medical Brief, volume 26\n1898\n\n*To take sufficient time for our meals seems frequently impossible* on account of the demands on our time made by our business... we act on the apparent belief that all of our business is so pressing that we must jump on the quickest car home, eat our dinner in the most hurried way, make the closest connection for car returning... \n-- Louis John Rettger, Studies in Advanced Physiology\n1898\n\nIn these days of increasing rapid artificial locomotion, *may I be permitted to say a word in favour of a very worthy and valuable old friend of mine, Mr Long Walk?*\n*I am afraid that this good gentleman is in danger of getting neglected, if not forgotten*. We live in days of water trips and land trips, excursions by sea, road and rail- bicycles and tricycles, tram cars and motor cars... but in my humble opinion, good honest walking exercise for health beats all other kinds of locomotion into a cocked hat. \n-- T. Thatcher, \"A plea for a long walk\", The Publishers' Circular\n1902\n\nThe art of conversation is almost a lost one. *People talk as they ride bicycles - at a rush - without pausing to consider their surroundings*... What has been generally understood as cultured society is rapidly deteriorating into baseness and voluntary ignorance. *The profession of letters is so little understood*, and so far from being seriously appreciated, that... newspapers are full, not of thoughtful honestly expressed public opinion on the affairs of the nation, but of vapid personalities interesting to none save gossips and busy bodies. \n-- Marie Corelli, Free Opinions, Freely Expressed\n1905\n\nThere is a great *tendency among the children of today to rebel against restraint*, not only that placed upon them by the will of the parent, but against any restraint or limitation of what they consider their rights... this fact has filled well minded people with great apprehensions for the future. \n-- Rev. Henry Hussmann, The Authority of Parents\n1906\n\n*Our modern family gathering, silent* around the fire, *each individual with his head buried in his favourite magazine*, is the somewhat natural outcome of the banishment of colloquy from the school...\n-- The Journal of Education, volume 29\n1907\n\nPlays in theatres at the present time present spectacles and *deal openly with situations which no person would have dared to mention in general society forty years ago*... The current representations of *nude men and women in the daily journals* and the illustrated magazines would have excluded such periodicals from all respectable families two decades ago... Those who have been divorced... forty and fifty years ago lost at once and irrevocably their standing in society, while to-day they continue in all their social relationships, hardly changed...\n-- Editorial, The Watchman, Boston\n1908\n\nWe write millions more letters than did our grandfathers, but the increase in volume has brought with it an automatic artificial machine-like ring... an examination of a file of old letters reveals not only a remarkable grasp of details, but a *fitness and courtliness too often totally lacking* in the mechanical curt cut and dried letters of to-day. \n-- Forrest Crissey, Handbook of Modern Business Correspondence\n1908\n\n*A hundred years ago it took so long and cost so much to send a latter that it seemed worth while to put some time and thought into writing it*. Now the quickness and the cheapness of the post seem to justify the feeling that *a brief letter to-day may be followed by another next week - a \"line\" now by another to-morrow*. \n-- Percy Holmes Boynton, Principles of Composition \n1915\n\n{{Title text: 'Unfortunately, the notion of marriage which prevails ... at the present time ... regards the institution as simply a convenient arrangement or formal contract ...
